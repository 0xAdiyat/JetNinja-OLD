# JetNinja

##JetNinja is a Java-based automation tool for signing up for a free trial account of IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, a popular integrated development environment (IDE) developed by JetBrains. The tool can also generate a temporary email address to use for the registration process to avoid the need for a real email address. JetNinja is designed to be run as a background process and can be easily configured to run on a schedule, making it a convenient tool for developers who need to periodically renew their IntelliJ IDEA trial accounts.
